This repo provides the scripts to create a local [kubernetes](kind/kind.sh)
cluster to be used for development or integration tests. It is also used in
[Github action](https://github.com/sustainable-computing-io/kepler-action) for kepler.

## Prerequisites for this REPO

- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)
- [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installing-from-release-binaries)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Please install the same version of `kubectl` and `kind` as Github-hosted runner.

Currently Kepler project's Github Action only supports `Ubuntu` based runners.

You can refer to tools list [here](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/ubuntu/Ubuntu2204-Readme.md#tools)

## Prerequisites (optional)

```bash
./main.sh prerequisites
```

Will setup ebpf on your host instance.

## Container runtime (optional)

```bash
./main.sh containerruntime
```

Will setup container runtime on your host instance.

## Startup

**note**: in 2024 July, we decoupled cluster config with kind cluster setup, so that we allow this repo to set up a existing cluster.

1. Modify kind [config](./kind/manifests/kind.yml) to make sure `extraMounts:` cover
   the linux header and BCC.
2. To setup local env run:

    ```bash
    ./main.sh up
    ./main.sh config
    ```

3. To tear down local env run:

    ```bash
    ./main.sh down
    ```

    Alternatively, use `.env` file to define and override the default configuration
    variables. E.g

    ```sh
    #.env

    PROMETHEUS_ENABLE=false
    GRAFANA_ENABLE=false
    TEKTON_ENABLE=false
    KUBEVIRT_ENABLE=false
    ```

    Start the cluster by running

    ```sh
    ./main.sh up
    ./main.sh config
    ```

## Container registry

There's a container registry available which is exposed at `localhost:5001`.

## Note for kepler contributor

To set up a local cluster for kepler development, we need to make the cluster
connected with a local container registry.

### Bump version step for this repo

1. Check kubectl version.
1. Check k8s cluster provider's version(as KIND).
1. Check prometheus operator version.

## How to contribute to this repo

### A new k8s cluster provider

Please feel free to refer to [kind provider implementation](providers/kind/kind.sh)
to contribute a k8s cluster. Please ensure that these checklist are statisfies
as Kepler requires certain feature to be available.

#### Checklist

- [ ] The provider related script should be placed under `'./provider/<name>/<name.sh>'`
- [ ] The script should have a `<provider>_up` function that sets up the k8s cluster.
- [ ] The script should have a `<provider>_down` function that deletes the cluster.
- [ ] The script should have a `<provider>_kubeconfig` function that prints
      the path to the cluster's kubeconfig that is located on host machine.
      Consider using `tmp/<provider>/kubeconfig` as the path to create/copy the
      kubeconfig file.

- [ ] Ensure cluster can pull from the local specific registry since for local
      development, we expect to push the development image to the local registry
      instead of a public registry.
- [ ] Mount local path of linux kernel and ebpf(BCC) inside kepler pod.

## Development

In order to make contributions to this repo, you need to have the following installed:

- [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install)

You can install pre-commit by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

After installing pre-commit, you need to install the pre-commit hooks by
running the following command:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

To run pre-commit manually

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
